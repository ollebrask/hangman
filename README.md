## Technologies Used

### Languages:

- [Python 3.12.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3122/): used to anchor the project and direct all application behavior.

- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/): used to provide the start script needed to run the Code Institute mock terminal in the browser.

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) used to construct the elements involved in building the mock terminal in the browser.

### Frameworks/Libraries, Programmes and Tools:
#### Python modules/packages:

##### Standard library imports:

- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) was used to implement pseudo-random number generation.
- [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html ) was used to clear the terminal.
##### Third-party imports:

- [Simple Terminal Menu](https://pypi.org/project/simple-term-menu/) was used to implement the menu.
- [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) was used to add colors and styles to the project.

#### Other tools:

- [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used as the main tool to write and edit code.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used for the version control of the website.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to host the code of the website.
- [Lucidspark](https://www.lucidspark.com/) was used to make a flowchart for the README file.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) was used to deploy the project.

## Bugs

+ **Solved bugs**

1. The function ```clear_terminal()``` didn't work at the correct time, it was interferring with the if, elif, else-statements. Former placement for function commented out in code below.

    - *Solutions:* Moved the ```clear_terminal()``` function inside of each if,elif,else-statement. See in the code below:

     ```python
    def game(word):
    """
    Printing the stage based on guesses and guessed letters
    Input for guessing letters
    When out of guesses or all correct letters, retry function runs
    """
    guesses = 5
    guessed_letters = set()
    while guesses > 0 and not all(
            letter in guessed_letters for letter in word):
        # clear_terminal()
        print(stages.stages[5 - guesses])
        print("Used letters:", " ".join(guessed_letters))
        print(
            "Word:", " ".join(
                letter if letter in guessed_letters
                else "_" for letter in word))

        while True:
            guess = input("Guess a letter: \n").strip().lower()
            if len(guess) == 1 and guess.isalpha():
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter only a single letter.")

        if guess in guessed_letters:
            clear_terminal()
            print("You already guessed that letter!")
        elif guess in word:
            clear_terminal()
            guessed_letters.add(guess)
            print("Correct!")
        else:
            clear_terminal()
            guessed_letters.add(guess)
            guesses -= 1
            print(f"Incorrect. You have {guesses} guesses left.")
      ```
